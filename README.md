### Pytorch Basics




#### Neural Network :

    * Neural network would be build using various blocks and functionalities, it would act like an human brain and neural network architecture was derived from the neurons present in the human brain

    * Neural network mostly contains an input layer, hidden layer and output layer. The dense of the neural network would be based on the number of hidden layers in the neural network

    * NN would be both forward and backward propagation network,
        -> In forward propagation the weights present in the network would not update and the accuracy would be low
        -> In backward propagation, chain rule would be applied and the weights would be updated based on the loss function

    * Neural network would be classified into two steps as Linear and Non Linear network, it would be works with the help of activation functions

    * Basically activation function would be in the every neurons to calculate the outcome with the input vector, along with their weights
